# Search-Algorithms
<p>In This project, I've implemented a simple program to simulate an N-tile puzzle - with different tile colors and weights.</p>
<p>The program receives an input file with the wanted configurations and can run one of the following algorithms to find the best solution according to the algorithm. See this <a href="input.txt">example</a> to understand the configurations</p>
<p>The algorithms that can be used are: A*, IDA*, BFS, BFBnB, and DFID. <br />I've used Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism in order to create a neat and scalable solution.</p>
